The web server hosts all the pretty web pages for the web site including the acual game client and matchmaking client. It also hosts the matchmaking system. Once a player's game client has been opened with an id for an assigned game instance from the matchmaking system, it connects (using websockets) to the game server. 
The game server should have been informed that a new game instance with a cirtain id has been created before clients start connecting. A game server process (see "Child Node.js Process") will handle the incoming websocket connections. There should be a way to make sure all connections for a cirtain game go to a specific process.
